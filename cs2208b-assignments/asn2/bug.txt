The bug in this program has to do with improperly accounting for piplining. The counter is supposed to count down and then eventually
branch. However, while the branch execution is being excecuted the processor is already fetching the function directly after it. As a
result after the branch instruction is executed it executes the inc instruction before going back to the loop label. The result is
the counter's value continuously cycling between 3 and 4 and hence the program gets stuck in the loop. This could be fixed by adding
a nop instruction after the branch instruction.
