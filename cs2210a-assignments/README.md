Data Structures and Algorithms
==============================

Course Description
------------------

Lists, stacks, queues, priority queues, trees, graphs, and their associated algorithms; file structures; sorting, searching, and hashing techniques; time and space complexity.

Assignment Descriptions
-----------------------

### Assignment 1

Theory based written assignment. No code.

### Assignment 2

Implements a compression algorithm to reduce the size of an input file. The program uses a modified version of the [Lempel-Ziv](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel-Ziv) algorithm to construct a tree based dictionary and compress the input file.

### Assignment 3

Theory based written assignment. No code.

### Assignment 4

Implements a dictionary using a binary tree. The dictionary is populated from an input file that contains words and then either text, audio, or picture descriptions. The user can search for words in the dictionary, read/listen/display a word's description, get predecessor and successors of words, and delete words.

### Assignment 5

Implements a maze solving program. The program reads in a "labyrinth" file and constructs a graph to represent all of the rooms and hallways of the maze. The program then finds a path from the start of the maze to the end of the maze using a depth-first search algorithm and shows the path with a provided graphical interface.
