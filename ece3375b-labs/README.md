Course Description
------------------

Basic elements of computers: central processing unit; memories; input/output devices; interfacing, software and hardware design, Computer Assisted Design; data handling and process control equipment; applications of microprocessors. Assembly language programming of a Motorola S12 microprocessor

Lab Descriptions
----------------

- Lab 1: Introduction to the S12 microprocessor, development board and the development environment (no code written by the student)
- Lab 2: Creating simple assembly language programs that can be used as helper functions in later labs. Programs implement keypad scanning, BCD to ASCII conversion, and a driver for the LED bar graph of the development board.
- Lab 3: Implementing a digital lock. Uses the previous lab code to read a password from a keypad and check if it is valid. It also initializes an LCD display and then shows a welcome or error message on the screen depending on whether a valid or invalid password was entered.
- Lab 4: Implements a digital thermometer. The program converts an analog temperature sensor reading to a digital value and then converts the input into a temperature in degrees celcius. Finally it displays the numerical value of the temperature on the LCD screen and a representation of it on the LED bar graph.
